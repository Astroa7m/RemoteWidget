Schedule image downloading/displaying in Glance widget with WorkManager API.

Every 15 minutes a new image is downloaded from the api and placed in the app widget. I wrote an [article](https://astroa7m.medium.com/schedule-image-displaying-in-glance-widget-with-work-manager-api-cc474ed8571c) about it in Medium.
