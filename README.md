# RemoteWidget
Schedule image downloading/displaying in Glance widget with WorkManager API.

Make sure you first grab an API key from [UnSplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and then place it in your `local.properties` file like so

`CLIENT_ID = "your_api_key"`

Every 15 minutes a new image is downloaded from the api and placed in the app widget. I wrote an [article](https://astroa7m.medium.com/schedule-image-displaying-in-glance-widget-with-work-manager-api-cc474ed8571c) about it in Medium.
